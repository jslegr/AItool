AI Tool for argument analysis

This FastAPI application provides an endpoint for analyzing user-submitted text based on three criteria: emotional tone, factual accuracy, and the presence of logical fallacies. It leverages the OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo API to perform natural language evaluation and returns a structured JSON response with scores and notes. The API is CORS-enabled for cross-origin testing and is designed for integration into educational or moderation tools that require quick and interpretable rhetorical analysis.
